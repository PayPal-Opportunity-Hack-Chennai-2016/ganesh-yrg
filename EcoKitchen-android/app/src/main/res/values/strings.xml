    <string name="aboutus">KATHIR is an innovative opportunity for disadvantaged urban women impacted by domestic/partner violence and in need of resources to care for people living with chronic and debilitating diseases. It helps them realize their livelihood aspirations.  The impact of KATHIR is manifold: Improved self-esteem for women Enhanced disposable incomes A purpose to be mobile - leaving the confines of their household Improved sense of empowerment Supports education, nutrition and health for their children Affordable, safe meals to the community  Process \"KATHIR\" is a retail opportunity. It offers meals for resale. KATHIR is popular because it respects work-life balance: women are expected to work between 11 AM and 3 PM, MON-SAT. This reduces conflict at home and allows time for women to play other roles expected by their society. They earn between Rs 300 - 400 each working day.</string>
